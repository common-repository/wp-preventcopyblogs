    * You have to provide your database details.For this,You have to create a mysql database under a user and all information in the settings page.If you dont provide them also,the plugin will work but it wont track the information of your fraudulent visitors.
    * If you need to track the visitors,you can either open your database from console or phpadmin page or from the admin page itself.You can see three columns -ip,referral_url and relative url which are for ip of the visitor,which website has referred you and the page ,he is currently viewing.
    *I have added the feature of displaying entries in database in the admin panel itself.You dont not need to login to your database any more.
